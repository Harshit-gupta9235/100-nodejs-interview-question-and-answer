1. What is Node.js?
Answer: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling fast, scalable network applications, particularly for real-time and I/O-heavy operations.
2. What are the key features of Node.js?
Answer: The key features include:
Non-blocking, asynchronous I/O.
Event-driven architecture.
Single-threaded with event looping.
Built-in libraries for HTTP, file system, etc.
Fast performance using the V8 engine.
3. What is an event-driven architecture in Node.js?
Answer: In Node.js, an event-driven architecture means the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, messages, or I/O. When an event occurs, a callback function is executed.
4. What is the role of the EventEmitter in Node.js?
Answer: EventEmitter is a core module in Node.js that allows objects to communicate asynchronously. It facilitates the handling of events in an event-driven model, like emitting and listening to events.
5. What is non-blocking I/O in Node.js?
Answer: Non-blocking I/O allows operations like reading from a file or database to happen asynchronously. Instead of waiting for the I/O operation to complete, Node.js moves on to the next operation and handles the result of the I/O when itâ€™s ready, using callbacks or promises.
6. Explain the single-threaded nature of Node.js.
Answer: Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop, but it can handle many concurrent operations using asynchronous I/O. It doesn't create new threads for every request; instead, it uses callbacks and event-driven programming to manage multiple operations concurrently.
7. What are streams in Node.js?
Answer: Streams are objects that let you read data or write data continuously in chunks. They are particularly useful for handling large amounts of data, like reading files or receiving data from network requests.
8. What are the different types of streams in Node.js?
Answer: The four types of streams are:
Readable: e.g., fs.createReadStream()
Writable: e.g., fs.createWriteStream()
Duplex: both readable and writable, e.g., sockets
Transform: modifies the data as it is read or written, e.g., zlib streams.
9. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js?
Answer: Synchronous programming waits for each operation to complete before moving to the next one, blocking the execution. Asynchronous programming allows operations to happen independently, using callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle the results when they are available.
10. How do you handle errors in Node.js?
Answer: Errors in Node.js can be handled using:
Error-first callbacks (e.g., callback(err, result)).
Promises (e.g., .catch() method).
try/catch block for handling exceptions in async/await.
11. What is middleware in Express.js?
Answer: Middleware in Express.js is a function that can access the request object (req), response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can execute code, modify the request and response, end the request-response cycle, or pass control to the next middleware.
12. How do you define a middleware function in Express.js?
Answer: A middleware function in Express is defined like this:
javascript
Copy code
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware called');
  next();
});
13. What are some built-in middleware in Express.js?
Answer: Common built-in middleware includes:
express.json(): Parses incoming JSON requests.
express.urlencoded(): Parses URL-encoded payloads.
express.static(): Serves static files like HTML, CSS, images.
14. What is routing in Express.js?
Answer: Routing refers to how an application responds to client requests for different endpoints (paths) with specific HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
15. How do you define a route in Express.js?
Answer: A route can be defined as follows:
javascript
Copy code
app.get('/path', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Response to GET request');
});
16. What is the role of the next() function in Express middleware?
Answer: The next() function is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack. If not called, the request-response cycle will be left hanging.
17. What is the difference between app.use() and app.get() in Express.js?
Answer: app.use() is used to apply middleware to all HTTP methods, while app.get() is used to define routes that handle only GET requests.
18. What are the HTTP methods supported by Express.js?
Answer: Express.js supports standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, and OPTIONS.
19. What is the difference between PUT and POST in RESTful APIs?
Answer: POST is used to create new resources, whereas PUT is used to update an existing resource or create it if it does not exist.
20. How do you handle form data in Express.js?
Answer: You can handle form data by using the express.urlencoded() middleware to parse URL-encoded bodies:
javascript
Copy code
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
21. What is CORS and how do you enable it in Express.js?
Answer: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism to allow or restrict resources on a web server depending on the origin of the request. You can enable CORS in Express.js using the cors middleware:
javascript
Copy code
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
22. What is a promise in Node.js?
Answer: A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
23. What is async/await in Node.js?
Answer: async/await is syntactic sugar over promises, making asynchronous code easier to read and write. Functions marked as async return a promise, and await pauses the execution until the promise resolves or rejects.
24. How do you read and write files in Node.js?
Answer: You can read files using fs.readFile() and write using fs.writeFile():
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
25. What is process.nextTick() in Node.js?
Answer: process.nextTick() is used to defer the execution of a function until the next iteration of the event loop, giving it higher priority than I/O operations.
26. What is a RESTful API?
Answer: A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manipulate resources identified by URIs.
27. How do you create a simple RESTful API in Express.js?
Answer: Here's a basic example:
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'GET request' });
});

app.post('/api/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'POST request' });
});

app.listen(3000);
28. What are query parameters in Express.js?
Answer: Query parameters are key-value pairs that appear after the question mark in a URL. They can be accessed using req.query:
javascript
Copy code
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  const { query } = req.query;
  res.send(`You searched for ${query}`);
});
29. What are route parameters in Express.js?
Answer: Route parameters are named segments of the URL that act as placeholders for dynamic values. They can be accessed using req.params:
javascript
Copy code
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
});
30. What is the package.json file in Node.js?
Answer: The package.json file holds metadata relevant to the project and manages project dependencies. It includes details like the name, version, scripts, and list of dependencies.
31. How do you manage dependencies in a Node.js project?
Answer: Dependencies are managed using npm or yarn. You can install packages using:
bash
Copy code
npm install <package-name>
The installed packages will be listed under the dependencies section of the package.json file.
32. What is the node_modules folder in Node.js?

javascript
Copy code
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
41. What is the next(err) function in Express.js?
Answer: next(err) passes control to the next error-handling middleware. If an error occurs, calling next(err) will skip over normal middleware and trigger error-handling middleware.
42. How do you handle errors globally in Express.js?
Answer: Error-handling middleware is defined as a function with four arguments: err, req, res, and next:
javascript
Copy code
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
43. What is the purpose of try/catch in async/await in Node.js?
Answer: try/catch is used in combination with async/await to handle errors that may occur in asynchronous code, as promises do not throw exceptions directly.
44. How do you handle file uploads in Express.js?
Answer: You can handle file uploads in Express using libraries like multer:

javascript
Copy code
function authorize(roles = []) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
    }
    next();
  };
}

app.get('/admin', authorize(['admin']), (req, res) => {
  res.send('Admin access');
});
56. What are WebSockets, and how do they differ from HTTP?
Answer: WebSockets provide full-duplex communication between the client and server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based, WebSockets allow for continuous, real-time communication.
57. How do you debug Node.js applications?
Answer: You can debug Node.js applications using the --inspect flag with node, along with Chrome DevTools or VS Code debugger:
bash

    expect(2 + 2).to.equal(4);
  });
});
85. What is cross-site scripting (XSS), and how do you prevent it in Node.js?
Answer: XSS is a type of security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web applications. You can prevent XSS by:
Validating and sanitizing user inputs.
Escaping special characters in HTML templates.
Using libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML.
86. What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking code in Node.js?
Answer: Blocking code waits for an operation to complete before continuing to the next one, while non-blocking code continues executing without waiting, handling the result via callbacks or promises. Node.js is designed for non-blocking I/O operations.
87. What is an ETag, and how does it work?
Answer: An ETag (Entity Tag) is an HTTP header used for caching purposes. It represents a version of a resource and helps to determine whether the resource has changed. If the ETag matches, the resource has not changed, and the server can respond with a 304 Not Modified status.
88. How do you secure an Express.js application?
Answer: To secure an Express app:
Use HTTPS.
Set HTTP headers with helmet.
Validate and sanitize user inputs.
Implement rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks.
Store sensitive data (like passwords) securely (e.g., hashing).
Protect against XSS and CSRF attacks.
89. What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling in Node.js?
Answer:
Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to distribute the load.
Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single machine (e.g., more CPU, RAM).
90. What is a virtual machine (VM) and how does it differ from a container?
Answer: A virtual machine emulates an entire operating system, with its own kernel, running on a host machine. A container, like Docker, shares the host's OS kernel but isolates the application environment. Containers are generally more lightweight and efficient than VMs.
91. What is CSRF, and how do you prevent it in Node.js?
Answer: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the server trusts. You can prevent it using anti-CSRF tokens that are included in forms and validated on the server-side.
92. What are streams in Node.js?
Answer: Streams are objects that allow you to read data or write data in chunks, rather than loading all data into memory at once. They are useful for handling large data, such as files or HTTP requests.
93. How does stream.pipe() work in Node.js?
Answer: stream.pipe() is used to pass the output of one stream as input to another stream, allowing you to chain streams together. For example, reading a file and writing it to an HTTP response:
javascript
Copy code
const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
readStream.pipe(res);
94. What is the cors middleware in Express.js?
Answer: The cors middleware enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing your API to be accessible from other domains. You can configure it like this:
javascript
Copy code
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
95. What is the role of middleware in Express.js?
Answer: Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request and response objects. They can modify the request, end the response, or pass control to the next middleware in the stack using next().
96. What is the difference between middleware and routing in Express.js?
Answer: Middleware functions are called before the route handler and can modify the request or response. Routes define the endpoints of your API and their respective HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
97. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH in RESTful APIs?
Answer:
PUT is used to update a resource by replacing it entirely.
PATCH is used to partially update a resource, only modifying certain fields.
98. What is a RESTful API?
Answer: A RESTful API is an architectural style for designing networked applications that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. It is stateless and typically uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
99. How do you handle CORS errors in Node.js?
Answer: CORS errors occur when a browser blocks a request from a different origin due to the same-origin policy. You can handle it using the cors middleware in Express:
javascript
Copy code
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://example.com' }));
100. What is Docker, and how is it used in Node.js development?
Answer: Docker is a platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production. In Node.js development, Docker is used to create isolated environments that run Node.js applications with all necessary dependencies, making deployment simpler and more scalable.
